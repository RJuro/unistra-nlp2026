TF-IDF Intuition: Signal vs. Noise
visual overlapping bars and text. can be 20% larger to give text more space

Matrix Factorization
visualize with real matrices - avoid overlaps
split up the slide if needed

add an extra slide for full screen ufo-village just before the curren slide 19

for slide 20

full slide - text below that is fitting. so...rework the visualizing embedding space slide a bit

Slide 23. the visualization deserves a full own slide. it is to small like that

slide 24. the visualization does not work. remove it. use the one from the previous slide instead.

the playlist analogy on slide 25 does now work. come up with something better
