  "concept": "A visualization of the self-attention mechanism. A sentence is displayed as individual word tokens in a horizontal row. Lines of varying thickness connect words that attend to each other. The word 'cat' strongly attends to 'sat' and 'mat' (thick lines), weakly to 'the' (thin lines). Below the sentence, a Query-Key-Value diagram shows the three vectors as colored bars feeding into the attention computation. Clean, educational, immediately readable.",
